landscape.cncf.io -  will give you the landscap on that need to be filled after leanrning dockers.


Dockers
--------

Install Docker on an Amazon EC2 instance:
-----------------------------------------
sudo yum update -y

sudo yum install docker

sudo service docker start or /bin/systemctl start docker.service 

sudo usermod -a -G docker ec2-user

When you install dDocker in the linic you have to install the docker machine and Docker compose:
Docker machine:
----------------
base=https://github.com/docker/machine/releases/download/v0.16.0 &&
  curl -L $base/docker-machine-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m) >/tmp/docker-machine &&
  sudo mv /tmp/docker-machine /usr/local/bin/docker-machine &&
  chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-machine
  
 Docker Compose:
----------------
sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.27.4/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
To install a different version of Compose, substitute 1.27.4 with the version of Compose you want to use.

sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose

mv docker-compose /usr/bin/



Images vs Container
---------------------
Image - is the dineary, liberyed and sorcecore that make up the application 
Container -  is running indtance of that image 

Management Commands:
  builder     Manage builds
  config      Manage Docker configs
  container   Manage containers
                run - create a new container - wehn it is run docker will look up in the local image chash first and it it did not find in the locally it will look in the docker hub.
                ls  - list all container
                stop - existing container
                start - will start existing container
                logs - show thw log of the specife conatiner 
                rm  - will remover conatiner for conatiner list 
                    Examples:
  
                      docker container run --publish 80:80 nginx
                                            it create the container called nignx and pupliching that in the port 80 
                      docker container run --publish -detach 80:80 nginx
                                            -detach will run the container in background 
                      docker container ls
                      docker container stop 
                      docker container ls -a 
                            CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS                     PORTS               NAMES
