It witten in the ashi corp conf lang with .tf extantion. it rewriten in the declarative mammer means - it do not run the run code but accutally check the cloud (where ever you are creating) and make sure it has all the instancres are persent. 

File system:
------------
Terraform foulder:
Terraform foulder is created when you run the terrafrom init so that it download the plugins that are need for the "provider" menctioned in the code. 

Terraform.tfstate:
Terraform creates a terrafrom.tfstate file to keep track for itself of what it created whenever terraform apply is run. it checks terraform.tfstate file to make sure what need to be added or changed. 
Bassically it's way for the terraaform to what is that it created.

Output
-----------
Will give you the desired traget that you sepcifi when you run the "terraform apply" or "terrafrom output" after the terraform apply. 

output "<name>"{
 value = <ressource name>.id
}


variable:
---------
Is used when give the input when you run the code, basscally it wil ask for the "enter value" and place that value in the menction place

-see variabtle.tf for the code 
        > ferraform apply -var "<terraform_resource name> = <Vallue>"
        
But in the workplace you don't use the either of this methods- terraform looks for the file called - "terraform.tfvars"
                                                                                                        > <terraform_resource name> = "10.0.100.0/24"



Providers
-----------
Terraform is used to create, manage, and update infrastructure resources such as physical machines, VMs, network switches, containers, and more. Almost any infrastructure type can be represented as a resource in Terraform.

A provider is responsible for understanding API interactions and exposing resources. Most providers configure a specific infrastructure platform (either cloud or self-hosted). Providers can also offer local utilities for tasks like generating random numbers for unique resource names.
 - To work with the terraform we need to install the nessary plugins to communate with the Providers.
